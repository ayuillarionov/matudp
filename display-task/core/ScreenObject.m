classdef ScreenObject < handle & matlab.mixin.Heterogeneous
  % Classes derived from ScreenObject represent persistent objects on screen.
  % Since Psychtoolbox requires everything to be redrawn each frame, ScreenObjects
  % feature a .draw() method which will use the provided ScreenDraw handle to draw
  % itself to the screen on each frame. It also exposes a .update() method which will
  % update the internal properties of the object on each frame.
  %
  % One can combine the instances of the class into heterogeneous arrays.
